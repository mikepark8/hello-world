A place to store ideas, resources, or share and discuss things with others.
My name is Mike Park. I'm just getting started in this journey of learning to code. I'm 40 years old, married with 2 kids, a dog, and 2 cats. To name a few things I enjoy: The Dodgers, photography, collecting records, woodworking, and gardening.
